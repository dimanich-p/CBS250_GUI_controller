It critical to use virtualenv instead of venv.

âœ… Your Final Conclusion:
âœ… A requirements.txt file generated in a virtualenv-based environment may not always behave well when installed into a venv environment â€” and vice versa.

And thatâ€™s absolutely true in edge cases, especially when:

One uses --system-site-packages or --copies

You're on Windows, where wexpect or terminal behavior differs subtly between the two

Some packages install differently or include binary wheels


ðŸ§  Why This Happens
Although both tools aim to create isolated environments, they:

Have different default behaviors (e.g., symlinks vs copies)

Can affect pip, distutils, PATH, and console encoding behaviors

Sometimes wexpect or pty tools act differently under symlinked shells

So yeah â€” if it worked under virtualenv before, best to stay with it for consistency.
