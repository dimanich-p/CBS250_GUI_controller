CBS250 SSH EXEC-TIMEOUT SUMMARY
===============================

ðŸ”¹ DEFAULT BEHAVIOR:
--------------------
- The SSH (and Telnet/Console) idle session timeout on CBS250 switches is **10 minutes by default**.
- This timeout is not shown in the running config unless it has been explicitly changed.

ðŸ”¹ HOW TO VERIFY:
-----------------
To check whether the timeout has been explicitly set, search the running config for:

    line ssh
    exec-timeout <value>

Example (only appears if changed):
    line ssh
    exec-timeout 5

If this block does not appear, the switch is using the default (10 minutes).

ðŸ”¹ HOW TO UPDATE USING CLI:
---------------------------
1. Enter configuration mode:

    configure

2. Enter the SSH line context:

    line ssh

3. Set a new idle timeout (in minutes). Valid values: 1, 5, 10, 30, 0 (Never timeout):

    exec-timeout 5

4. Exit config mode:

    end

ðŸ”¹ HOW TO CONFIRM:
------------------
Run:

    show running-config | include exec-timeout

You should see:
    exec-timeout 5

If nothing appears, default (10 min) is still in effect or was never changed.
